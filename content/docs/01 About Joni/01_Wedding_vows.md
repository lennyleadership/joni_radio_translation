Hey, something pretty big is happening this Sunday!   

I’m Joni Eareckson Tada and on July 3, I’ll be celebrating 40 years of marriage to the amazing, one-of-a-kind Ken Tada. Where have four decades flown to?! And I mean it. These past 40 years have zoomed by, and my husband and I are so grateful to God, we’re so thankful for his faithfulness in keeping us both true to our marriage vows, all these many decades. You know, I clearly remember sitting in my wheelchair up in front of the congregation that day; sitting there in my wedding dress, looking up into Ken’s face, vowing to love, honor, and obey him. I mean, back then, that was really saying something. No way did I realize what in the world I was getting myself into, but despite all the questions about how my disability routines would figure into this marriage, at least I knew the faithfulness of my God and his grace to sustain would make us through. And it’s a good thing. Because with my quadriplegia in the middle of a brand-new marriage, with all its demands, this disability, well, let’s just say the honeymoon did not last very long. Those first five years were pretty rocky, and even scary. Scary for both of us! There were some sad times when Ken would back away and he’d insist, “Joni, I can’t do it; this is just too much,” to which I would bark back at him, “Well, what about me? Don’t you think it’s too much for me?!” And then we’d spiral downward. It was like that for a few years, but praise the Lord, through much prayer, getting anchored into Scripture, things **smoothed out**. We stuck with it. And it’s why Ken Tada and I are so grateful for those vows that we made.   

In short, we crazy-glued our stubborn, willful hearts to the promises we made on our wedding day. Over the years, our wedding vows have kept our feet to the fire – or, in my case, my wheelchair parked in place. And you know why? Because from the very beginning, we considered each of those vows as binding. **Binding**. Numbers 30 says, “If a man makes a vow to the Lord… with a binding obligation, he shall not violate his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.” Yep, a marriage promise that you make before the Lord and before witnesses is binding. Tim Keller once said, “wedding vows are not a declaration of present love, but a mutually binding promise of future love.” Now let me say that again because it’s so important – when you promise your spouse for better or for worse, you are not declaring the state of your present love; you are making “a binding promise of future love.” Like, “I take you, from this day forward, for better or for worse, richer or poorer, in sickness and health, to love and to cherish until death do us part.” In other words, being yours might cost me more than I ever thought I could give – more than I can now imagine – but I promise to never leave you. Oh, friend, we are so like God when we promise never to leave the ones to whom we’re committed. It’s the kind of promise Jesus made to us, right?  

Sure, every marriage is filled with difficulties, and there will be failure; the future is fragile for every couple – but wedding vows are what help a man and a woman to not only honor each other, but honor the Lord. Hey, Ken Tada and I have posted a few photos of our wedding day from 40 years ago, so take a peek at joniradio.org. And my final word? Never leave the one whom you’ve vowed to love. God bless you today, and thanks for listening.
