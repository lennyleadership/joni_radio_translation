Proverbs warns that the fear of man is a snare. Looking to people for approval, significance, or happiness results only in stress and anxiety. Want to alleviate that worry and stress? Exchange your fear of man for a fear of the Lord - because fearing the Lord leads to life!

Wouldn’t you agree – we live in a world filled with fear.

Hi, I'm Joni Eareckson Tada, and I see it, I read about it, I hear it all the time. Especially from mothers of teenagers and pre-teens. Well, I take that back. I hear about fear from many women my own age. ’Cause we live in a fear-based culture, but the Bible calls it a “fear of man.” And when the Bible talks about fear that way, it’s basically saying, “The Lord is not the one you fear; rather, you fear others; you fear what they think of you; they are the real god in your life, not the God of the Bible. They are the ones you hold in esteem; the ones who control you, who master you. You fear their opinion more than you do God’s.” Wow. And it is why Proverbs 29 says, “Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is kept safe.” 

Boy, Proverbs is spot on. A fear of man is a snare. Even I fall into that trap. I fear that I will look stupid if I fail to properly fill out a ministry expense account. I fear what a fellow board member will think if I make an unwise decision. I fear I will be frowned upon if, when I write, I fail to credit someone else’s material. I’ll tell you, though, I do everything I can to rise above that. I strive to make wise decisions for the sake of Christ, not what others think; and, yes, I try my best to give credit where credit is due because it reflects well on the Lord; and, yes, I attempt to sharpen my skills when revealing accounting ledgers because it’s prudent; it’s important for its own sake. I don’t know, maybe you struggle with similar things. Maybe your fear of man takes a different shape. 

Although you can be an avowed worshiper of God, below the surface, the real “god” might be others around you. To fear man means not only being afraid of someone and their opinion; it also might mean holding that opinion in awe, or being controlled or mastered by the feelings of others. Putting all your trust in people, or needing others in an unhealthy way. Maybe you “paint on a smile” or “put on a front” when you’re with those you want to impress. Perhaps you seek others’ opinions because you need them to shore up your sense of well-being or identity. Or maybe you are afraid of being exposed as an imposter. In short, you replace God with people. The fear of man goes by other names, too. I think teenagers call it “peer-pressure;” adults call it “people-pleasing.” Psychologists label it “codependency.” So how do you avoid falling into the trap of fearing man?

Well, so much of our stress could be alleviated if we exchanged a fear of man for a healthy fear of the Lord. We need a way to think less often about ourselves, and more often about God. Proverbs 19 says, “The fear of the Lord leads to life: Then one rests content, untouched by trouble.” And I would add, untouched by stress, as well. Look, there’s so much more I would like to say on this topic, so let’s leave fear behind. And let me help you with a special pamphlet I want to give you today, called Breaking the Bonds of Fear. Go to joniradio.org, and ask for your free copy. Because God is the one who is awesome and glorious, not other people. Let’s grow in the fear of the Lord – because the person who fears God will fear nothing else! Read more about it today at joniradio.org. Again joniradio.org. And like Max Lucado says, let’s meet our fears with faith. That is the way to face life.
