All of God’s anger against your sin was poured out on Christ on his cross. He has no anger left for you, only mercy. Yes, Hebrews 12:6 says that God will discipline you through suffering, but it is never out of anger.

## English Transcript
Welcome to a week of lessons from my wheelchair.

Hi, I’m Joni Eareckson Tada, and on July 30 I’ll be on my knees, as it were – not actually, but you know what I mean. I’ll be spending that day in gratitude to God for all the many ways he has drawn me close to him through this wheelchair. Because this weekend will mark more than five decades since the diving accident when I broke my neck. And all this week I’m highlighting the most important things I’ve learned over these more than five decades, in hopes that you, too, can benefit from these lessons in your own afflictions. And you know, as I look back, I am dismayed at the many lies that I used to believe about my suffering. So, okay, lie number one: when I broke my neck, I thought my life was ruined; I thought I’d missed God’s best for my life, that it could never be recovered. Lie number two: I thought that God was punishing me for some awful sin, and that he could not be trusted, that he would never deal with one of his children so harshly. And lie number three: I was completely convinced I would not make it; I could not do it; that I would never survive in a wheelchair or ever be able to smile again. Now, there are many more lies that deceived me way back when, but those are at least three key ones.

And I’m sure you see yourself in some of those lies. Like when suffering hits you broadside, you assume your life is ruined, it’s over, you’ve missed God’s best for your life, you’ve missed plan A; and things will never be the same. Now, although it is true that things will never be the same, suffering does not mean that you have missed God’s best plan for your life. Ephesians 1 assures that God works out everything – broken hearts, broken homes, broken necks – he works everything in conformity with the purpose of his will. So, there are no “accidents,” as it were, in the Christian’s life. There is no cosmic flip of the coin or roll of the dice. God always, always has your best interests at heart when he allows suffering to completely alter the status quo. So, please remember Ephesians 1:11. God is in control for your good and his glory.

And about that second lie, that God is punishing us, well, please remember that all of God’s anger against your sin was poured out on Christ on his cross. He has no anger left for you, only mercy. Yes, Hebrews 12:6 says that God will discipline you through suffering, but it is never out of anger. It is always for reasons that are wise, specific, and good, although that good may be hidden in this life and not revealed until the next. And what about that third lie? That you won’t make it, that you can’t do it? Well, in a way, you can’t. But even I learned early on, that’s a good thing. Because I cannot do quadriplegia, but I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Philippians 4:13 is your guarantee that when you are weak and can’t do it, he is strong and can.

Now I want you to notice that when I was learning to come to grips with my paralysis, when I was struggling to overcome those lies, it was the truth of Scripture that brightened my path. And that has been one of the biggest lessons I’ve learned these many years in the chair. When we learn God’s Word, we are replacing every lie with a truth. We are rebuilding our thought patterns, elevating our thinking, and gaining true wisdom. When we soak ourselves in the truth of Scripture, we are possessing the mind of Christ. And that is a great lesson! So, join me next time to learn more reasons why I’m celebrating so many years in this wheelchair.
