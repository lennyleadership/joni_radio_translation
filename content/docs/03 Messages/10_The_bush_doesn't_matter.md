We are like Moses’ burning bush, vessels through which the Lord speaks. There was nothing special about that bush, yet God chose to use it for his glorious purposes! How much more so will he use us?  

我们就像摩西看到的那簇荆棘，上帝在那里面说话。那簇荆棘再普通不过了，可是，上帝却使用它来成就祂荣耀的目的。那么，上帝更会使用我们。

## Eglish Transcript
I love the book of Exodus, and let me tell you why.  

Hi, I’m Joni Eareckson Tada, and that book alone is filled with so many fascinating stories. But of all the stories, there’s nothing quite like the one shared in the third chapter of Exodus. Okay, now here’s the deal: Moses is out in the desert – he’s fled Egypt and is living with a tribe of Midianites; in fact, he married one - anyway, Moses was tending the flocks of his father-in-law out in the desert, and he came to Mount Horeb. It was there Moses was drawn to a very strange sight. It was a desert shrub, a bush that was glowing in a halo of fire, and yet it didn’t burn up. Now that was a weird sight. In verse 3, Moses says to himself, "I will go over and see this strange sight – why the bush does not burn up." As Moses drew closer, perhaps he thought it was a remarkable new kind of foliage unlike the rest of the desert scrub brush. Then, what a shock to see the glowing fire and hear the voice of God Almighty speak from inside the scraggly branches. Moses quickly took off his sandals. He was standing on sacred ground, holy ground. It was a never-before-encounter between man and the great I Am, the Yahweh, the Lord God Almighty.

And Moses would never be the same. Weeks later, though, I wonder what happened to that bush. Before Moses moved on, leaving the bush behind, I don’t think he broke off the branches to enshrine them in a little box on an altar. He did not uproot the bush to memorialize it. He did not erect an altar or a mausoleum to venerate the bush, as though it were now elevated to a sacred category above the average desert shrub. No. I think that bush just went back to being an ordinary scraggly bush. And that’s a powerful lesson, for as Major Ian Thomas has said, when it comes to God choosing the bush through which he would spoke, honestly, “Any old bush would have done. A scruffy, scraggly looking thing or a beautiful looking bush so shapely and fine. The bush is not important–only that God was in the bush!”

The burning bush is an Old Testament example of a New Testament truth: Christ in you, the hope of glory. You, friend, are his bush, you are his scrub brush, and God can set any life ablaze with Spirit‐inspired power. His Holy Spirit, the same God that spoke from the shrub on Mount Horeb, God lives within you. And God can choose whatever bush he wants. You could be a lowly outcast or an honored aristocrat. You can be an unskilled person with lackluster gifts, or someone with great talents who’s bright and beautiful. The “you” doesn’t matter. What does matter is Christ in you. Just like with Moses, the bush through which God chose to speak was not the issue; what mattered was that God was in the bush. And you are the same, dear friend. But unlike that desert bush, the Lord will not depart from you if you are a child of God, redeemed and forgiven, and sealed with the Holy Spirit. All because of Colossians 1. It says there that “God has chosen to make known [to you] the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.” Oh, what a privilege, what an honor to be the bush God chooses! So, join me in praying, “Oh, Jesus, please, let me burn for you. Set my heart aflame. Let your presence within me glow. Shine through me, Jesus. Today, let me burn for you.”

我喜欢读《出埃及记》，因为这本书里满是一个个精彩的故事。不过没有一个故事能与第三章的故事相比。

故事是这样的。摩西逃出埃及，到了米甸族那里，并且结了婚。摩西负责牧养岳父的羊群。一天他牧羊到了何烈山。在那里他见到了最奇特的景象。有一簇荆棘着了火，却不见它被烧毁。第三节写道，‪摩西说：“我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢？”他走近的时候，心里还在想这一簇与众不同。可是眼前熊熊烈火震惊到他，而且他又听到上帝从里面向他说话。摩西于是快快地拖下鞋子，因为他站在圣地。从来没有发生过这样的事情。摩西从此不再一样。

几周后，我还在琢磨那一簇荆棘的事。摩西离开前，他没有折一段枝子，放进一个盒子里，摆在祭坛上供奉；他没有将荆棘连根拔起来作一个标记；他也没有在旁边筑起一座祭坛以供奉它。什么也没有！这簇灌木没有比其它灌木特别一点，圣洁一点。这里边有一个道理，仪昂.托马斯少校这样说，上帝挑了任意一簇荆棘，不管多难看、还是多漂亮。重点不是荆棘，而是在荆棘里的上帝!

旧约里的荆棘代表着新约里的一个真理：你里面的基督，荣耀的盼望。朋友，你就是祂的荆棘，属祂的。上帝能用祂的大能挑旺任何一个生命之火。那昔时在何烈山上显现在荆棘里的圣灵，如今住在你里面。上帝可以随时挑选一簇荆棘。你可以是不起眼的小人物，可以是社会名流；可以是没有一技之长的人，可以是满有天赋的人。你是什么人不重要，重要的是在你里面的基督。而且，与荆棘不同的是，你一旦作了祂的孩子，你被救赎出来，被赦罪，有圣灵的印记，上帝就不会离开你。‪歌罗西书‬1:27 和合本 神愿意叫他们知道，这奥秘在外邦人中有何等丰盛的荣耀，就是基督在你们心里成了有荣耀的盼望。

哦！如此殊荣！能成为上帝拣选的一簇荆棘！请跟我一起祷告：亲爱的耶稣，让我为你燃烧！挑旺我心灵的火焰！让你的生命从我里面发光！耶稣，就是今天！让我为你燃烧！
