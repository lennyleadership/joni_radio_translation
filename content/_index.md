I was inspired and touched by Joni and Friends 4-minute Radio program hosted by Joni Eareckson Tada many years ago.  Her messages are not Chicken Soups for the Soul to me.  I guess that is not her intent, instead her messages led me, a non-physically handicapped Christian, to Jesus - my Lord.  I am one of her followers, but more than that, as she follows Jesus, my eyes focus on Jesus.  That is the power of her messages.

I had an idea of translating some of the messages to Chinese.  With permission by their organization, I launched my mission.  This website is in trial stage.  

I wish this collection of Joni's message would make you understand more of Jesus - your Lord.
