I was inspired and touched by Joni and Friends 4-minute Radio program hosted by Joni Eareckson Tada many years ago.  Her messages encouraged me, a non-physically handicapped Christian, to know more my Lord.

I had an idea of translating some of the messages to Chinese.  With permission by their organization, I launched my mission.  This website is in trial stage.
