Aug 7, 2022</span>

I was inspired and touched by Joni and Friends 4-minute Radio program hosted by Joni Eareckson Tada many years ago.  Although there have been encouragement and hope in her messages, Joni would expect us to move our focus away from our circumstances to our Jesus.  She would expect us less self-centeredness, but more Jesus-centeredness.  That is her intent, her messages are not the "Chicken Soups for the Soul" from my perspective.  That is the power of her messages.

I had an idea of translating some of the messages to Chinese.  With permission by their organization, I launched my mission.  This website is in trial stage.  

I wish this collection of Joni's messages with Chinese translation would make you be thirsty to seek Jesus - your Lord in every circumstance like a deer after water.
